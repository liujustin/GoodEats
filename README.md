## About

This project was built during [Brickhack 6](https://brickhack6.devpost.com/) as a way to help foodies
gain better insight as to what others are saying about a restaurant/establishment so that they can make a more
informed chice of whether to try it out.

### Inspiration

We started with the idea of tackling Wegman's challenge and knew we wanted to help users compare products to save time and money and make the shopping experience seamless.

We ran into the problem of not knowing if products had a universal id across platforms and Wegmans seemed to be the only API we had access to (Walmart was closed beta, other big one's like Stop And Shop and ShopRite didnt have). This meant that we couldn't compare products so we scrapped that idea.

We then found that when looking at places to eat, we always found that we were exclusively looking at Yelp for reviews from the community. However, we knew that there was a whole other community within Google Local Guides that have more reviews from people so we thought it would be a good idea to put the two together and have a site where the reviews were an aggregation from both sources for a more unbiased/harsh review. We then decided to add Foursquare as well as we knew it also might have some good reviews from the small community it has.

### What it does

A user can look up a restaurant and Good Eats will give a comprehensive review from multiple sources (Yelp, Google Local Guides, Foursquare).

Reviews include cards for each source that let the user know the overall rating and total number of reviews in addition
to a couple of written reviews grabbed from the sources themselves.
